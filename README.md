An observable is an architectural pattern that extends the MVVM pattern. According to it, the view can be bound not only to the model, but also to a certain class with data (the observed entity), which is located in the model. Changes to the observable entity fields cause the view to update. Thus, the observed entity is, in a sense, a continuation of the model.

This framework is an implementation of the observable entity pattern for Android, based on the "generator" framework, since it provides the most convenient MVVM implementation for Android.

This framework also has one great killer feature that solves an important global development problem. Read on to find out!
